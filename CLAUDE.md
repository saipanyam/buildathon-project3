# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Buildathon project repository for "project3" - a rapid AI solution prototype developed as part of a multi-stage competition. The project is currently in a minimal state with only a README file present.

## Repository Structure

The repository is currently in its initial state with:
- A basic README.md describing the project context
- No package management files (no package.json, requirements.txt, or pyproject.toml detected)
- No source code directories or files yet

## Development Status

This appears to be a freshly initialized repository with no established build system, dependencies, or code structure yet. Future development work will need to:
- Determine the target technology stack
- Set up appropriate package management and dependency files
- Establish project structure and build processes
- Add linting and testing frameworks as appropriate for the chosen stack
